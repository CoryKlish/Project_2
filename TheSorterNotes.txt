Need to be able to weird shit in the movie title (number, '#')
	How do we order the titles with numbers in them?
		Maybe look at the next character, if it is 0, then it is first. If it is 1 then it is next, if 2 then next, etc.
	There is a movie called AEon Flux with a weird 'ae' symbol as one character.
	Also a movie with '[' at the beginning, one with 'e' instead of capital, "xXx" , 
	If a movie just starts with a letter and the next char is ' ', '-','.', or an integer, where to put
	E' how to handle?

There are going to be cells that are blank within the row, how to sort blank?
	Some directors in the list appear more than once
	Do we sort by first name or last name?
